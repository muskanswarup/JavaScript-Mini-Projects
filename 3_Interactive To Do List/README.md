# To-Do List Application

This project is a simple To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks to the list, mark them as completed, and remove them.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can type a task into the input field and add it to the list by clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark as Completed**: Clicking on a task will mark it as completed by striking through the text and changing the background color. Clicking again will unmark it.
- **Remove Tasks**: Each task has a close button (`X`) to remove it from the list.
- **Error Handling**: If the user tries to add an empty task, an error message will be displayed.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the To-Do List.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the To-Do List.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the To-Do List.
